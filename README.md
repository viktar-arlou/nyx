### Nyx

Nyx Collections is an **experimental** Java library that offers an implementation of standard Java Collections API with collection elements allocated in the off-heap memory. It is designed to support an XL-size collections which makes it ideal choice for implementing memory and computationally intensive applications.

###Features
* Thread-safe high-speed implementation of List, Set, Map and Queue collections with data elements allocated in off-heap memory. 
* Specifically designed for XL size collections it ensures high throughput and memory conservation.
* Extended Nyx Collections API allows for easy and efficient implementation of various computation scenarios with operations like #foreach, #filter, #mapTo.  

###Examples
```
/* Create Nyx List collection */
List<MyObject> nyx = new NyxList<>();

/* Filters out null elements */
List<Integer> list1 = Fn.on(list).filter(Fn.<Integer>notNull()).get();

/* Filters out elements outside given range */
list1 = Fn.on(list1).filter(Fn.<Integer>range(0, 5)).get();

/* A field of an anonymous class can be used to accumulate and return computation result */
int sum = Fn.on(list1).forEach(new Fn.NoRet<Integer>() {
	int counter = 0;
	@Override public void func(Integer t) { counter += t; }
}).counter;
```
### Requirements

Nyx collections can be used with Java 9/10 platform.

### Releases

* v0.3
    - Upgraded to support Java 9/10
* v0.2
	- New extended API for easy Nyx collections traversal and modifications (foreach, mapTo, filter).
	- Asynchronous data exchange with off-heap storage for better throughput. 
* v0.1
	- Implementation of Java collections allocated in off-heap memory. 
	- Uses standard Java serialization mechanism to move data objects.
	- GC detection for Nyx Collections housekeeping facilities.
